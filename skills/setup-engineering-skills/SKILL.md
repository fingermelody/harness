# Setup Engineering Skills

Scaffold the per-repo configuration that the engineering skills assume:

- **Issue tracker** — where issues live (GitHub by default; local markdown is also supported)
- **Triage labels** — the strings used for the five canonical triage roles
- **Domain docs** — where `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs live, and the consumer rules for reading them

This is a prompt-driven skill, not a deterministic script. Explore, present what you found, confirm with the user, then write.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Look at the current repo to understand its starting state. Read whatever exists; don't assume:

- `git remote -v` and `.git/config` — is this a GitHub repo? Which one?
- `CODEBUDDY.md` at the repo root — does it exist? Is there already an `## Agent skills` section?
- `CONTEXT.md` and `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root
- `docs/adr/` and any `src/*/docs/adr/` directories
- `docs/agents/` — does this skill's prior output already exist?
- `.scratch/` — sign that a local-markdown issue tracker convention is already in use

### 2. Present findings and ask

Summarise what's present and what's missing. Then walk the user through the three decisions **one at a time**.

**Section A — Issue tracker.**

Default posture: these skills were designed for GitHub. If a `git remote` points at GitHub, propose that. Otherwise, offer:

- **GitHub** — issues live in the repo's GitHub Issues (uses the `gh` CLI)
- **GitLab** — issues live in the repo's GitLab Issues (uses the `glab` CLI)
- **Local markdown** — issues live as files under `.scratch/<feature>/` in this repo
- **Other** (Jira, Linear, etc.) — ask the user to describe the workflow

**Section B — Triage label vocabulary.**

The five canonical roles:

- `needs-triage` — maintainer needs to evaluate
- `needs-info` — waiting on reporter
- `ready-for-agent` — fully specified, AFK-ready
- `ready-for-human` — needs human implementation
- `wontfix` — will not be actioned

Default: each role's string equals its name. Ask the user if they want to override any.

**Section C — Domain docs.**

Confirm the layout:

- **Single-context** — one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root
- **Multi-context** — `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root pointing to per-context `CONTEXT.md` files

### 3. Confirm and edit

Show the user a draft of:

- The `## Agent skills` block to add to `CODEBUDDY.md`
- The contents of `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`, `docs/agents/domain.md`

Let them edit before writing.

### 4. Write

If a `CODEBUDDY.md` exists, edit it. If not, ask the user which file to create.

If an `## Agent skills` block already exists, update its contents in-place rather than appending a duplicate.

The block:

```markdown
## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

[one-line summary of where issues are tracked]. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

[one-line summary of the label vocabulary]. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

[one-line summary of layout]. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
```

Then write the three docs files.

### 5. Done

Tell the user the setup is complete and which engineering skills will now read from these files.
